# 🚀 GTM Agentic AI Engine

> **Autonomous revenue engine that scores, routes, and acts on CRM leads — fully free, fully local, zero external dependencies.**

Built on a 5-layer architecture that takes raw CRM data and transcripts, scores every lead using an LLM judge, runs autonomous AI agents to make routing decisions, and dispatches the results to reps via a production-ready REST API.

---

## ⚡ What It Does

Drop in a CSV of leads. The engine:

1. **Ingests** raw CRM data and call transcripts into a local data warehouse
2. **Embeds** all unstructured text into a semantic vector index for intelligent retrieval
3. **Scores** every lead 0–100 using an LLM judge + deterministic business rules
4. **Routes** each lead through 3 autonomous AI agents that reason, decide, and format
5. **Dispatches** rep assignments, CRM stage updates, and Slack alerts — all via REST API

## 🧠 The Agentic Layer (Layer 4)

Three CrewAI agents run sequentially for each lead — each one builds on the previous agent's output:

| Agent | Role | Tool | Output |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| Senior Lead Analyst | Reads CRM data + pulls transcript context | ChromaDB retriever | 3–5 sentence signal summary |
| GTM Decision Strategist | Applies rules to the summary | GTM rules engine | priority · urgency · rep_tier |
| Structured Output Formatter | Converts decision to JSON | None | Clean JSON routing decision |

The blend of **probabilistic LLM reasoning** (Layer 3 scoring + Agent analysis) with **deterministic logic** (rules engine caps/floors/overrides) ensures no lead is misdirected due to a hallucination.
